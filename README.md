# Walking-speed-Detection-by-Human-Gait-Analysis
A Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) Machine Learning model to predict the walking speed of a person using the gait data of that person while walking. 
Proposed a CNN model to classify Human Walking Speed of a moving person through the data of angles made by different joints. 
It will help in the deep study of human gait and to keep the track record of a personâ€™s fitness level.
